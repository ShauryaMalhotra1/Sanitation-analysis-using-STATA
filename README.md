# Sanitation-analysis-using-STATA

#The dataset is on the sanitation situation of Uttar Pradesh in 2014 and 2017. NSSO rounds on Social Consumption (Healthcare utilization)- 71st Round (2014) and 75th Round (2017) have been selected for the data analysis.

I have cleaned the data before merging our datasets. I added some new variables by using the recode function on each dataset and removed some variables that did not play an essential role in my analysis. I have merged the data into a combined dataset on which I have done my further analysis.

I have also done the regression by using the logit function where I created dummy variables and also used or option, which has given the odds ratio. I used the odds ratio for our further analysis.

The chi-square test and the post estimation test (Wald Test), which helped me find the relationship between the variables. It also enabled me to prove our null hypothesis.

I have calculated the proportion of our target variable for each year to do a district-wise analysis. I have used the proportion function to get the required result. I have also used some excel formulas that helped me find which state has done exceptionally well in these three years.
